# BlockRandomizer

This is a simple Blockrandomizer plugin for PaperMC servers.

### What does it?
- Every block a player breaks, drops a randomized item/block from all items that exists in the game. 
Blocks or items that should not be dropped are listed in the config file.
- Also the Chest content can be randomized.
- If the server crashed or restarted, the Block to Drop mapping is saved in another config file and 
can be restored.
- If you want a new world you can simple reset it!
