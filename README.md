## BlockRandomizer
- **Every block** a player breaks, **drops a randomized item/block** from all items that exists in the game. Blocks or items that should not be dropped are listed in a config file.
- Also the **Chest content** can be **randomized**.
- If the server crashed or restarted, the **Block to Drop mapping** is saved and **will be restored**.
- If you want a new World or a new Randomizer you can simply create a one!
- Do **/randomizer** to open den randomizer settings Inventory.
